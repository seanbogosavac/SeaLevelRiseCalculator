# Sea Level Rise Calculator

A French version of this readme can be found [here](https://github.com/seanbogosavac/SeaLevelRiseCalculator/blob/main/README_FR.md).

This project was realised for my Assisted Personnal Initiative Project (TIPE), as part of the French Engineering School Entrance Process in 2021.

## How to run

## Extras

* The code has been refactored as a side project, and I then built an interface in C# to use it in a more understandable way. However, this was not present when I first made the code back in 2021. The original code can be found in [this initial commit](https://github.com/seanbogosavac/SeaLevelRiseCalculator/commit/eb9a1bcaed7dfc6c2f2fb35e66b63b13085b3585).


* This program was in fact made out of two scripts.
The second one was supposed to be a script that would help to compute the most cost-effective dyke to build on a given coast. However, it is not working anymore and I cannot figure out how to get it to work again, so it will stay in standby for now.
